  <h2><b> About me:</b> </h2>
  <p>
   My name is Paige Hovanes and I am from Appleton, Wisconsin. This is my third year at UW-Madison studying Strategic Communications in the school of Journalism and Mass Communications. I am also working towards two certificates. One in digital studies and the other in photography. This is the first computer-related class I have ever taken and it is really testing my technological abilities.
